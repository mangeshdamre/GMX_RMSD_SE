# RMSD with Std. Error plot
Use the script to calculate the RMSD of a protein from molecular dynamics simulations performed by GROMACS.
`gmx rmsd -h` is used to calculate the rmsd of a protein with given selection.
Having multiple simulations of similar setup, it is worth while to look into RMSDs and Std. Error related to it.
### RMSD
**Root Mean Square Deviation.** The Root Mean Squared Deviation (RMSD) is defined as:
```math
SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
```
